# Ultrasonic_sensor
This Project Repository is about How to interface an Ultrasonic Sensor with an arduino using tinkercad. 
# Software Required:-
NOTE:---- This project can be prepared both by Hardware as well as software, For hardware makesure you have all the required components and ARDUINO IDE installed for running the code. 
For Software:-
1. To, run this Arduino circuits , one need to have an account in the tinkercad website available in google or any search engine. 
2. After making the account, one can click on "create" option available there on the home page and then click on circuit design.
3. On the circuit design page, from the right side tab of lists of componenets, select the components required for your circuit design and 
then drag and drop that circuit components to the blank area, in order to create the design there.
# Cicuit connection:-
The circuit connection for interfacing an ultrasonic sensor with Arduino uno is attached and already uploaded in the Repository, and  you can view and prepare your own circuit from there.
Note** The cicuit connections can be prepared in hardware also, it will work for hardware as well.
# Explanation of Circuit connections:-
1. From the list of components page Drag and drop one ARDUINO UNO board and one Ultrasonic Sensor.
2.  Connect the Vcc pin of ultrasonic sensor to 5V power of Arduino.
3.  Connect the Trig pin to digital pin 10.
4.  Connect the Echo pin to digital pin 9.
5.  Connect the ground pin to ground of Arduino.
6.  Note that you can change the colour of the wires.
# Code:- 
The code required for the simulation of this circuit design is uploaded in the Repository, Make sure that you have the Arduino software IDE installed from google chrome. Or Write the code in tinkercad side code tab to simulate the circuit. 
# Results:- 
On simulating the code, We can view the output on the Serial monitor, where we can see that there is distance wriiten on the serial monitor window, now c=in clicking on the uktrasonic sensor we can see that there is the object placed at a distance, on moving the object close to the ultrasonic sensor, the distance increases as well it is viewed in the serial monitor. likewaise if we move away then distance decreases. indicating how the ultrasonic sesnor can identify the object and there distances required for transmitting its ultrasonic sound signal from the transmitter to the reciever.
